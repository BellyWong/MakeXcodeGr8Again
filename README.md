# Make Xcode Gr8 Again
Xcode + Plugins = ðŸ’™ 

## About
A Mac App to reenable plugins on Xcode. **Use at your own risk.**

## Usage
Currently there are two modes of usage: regular and YOLO.

### Regular
Simply drag your Xcode 8 App into the window. A new Xcode app will be created allowing the use of plugins.

### YOLO
Toggle the YOLO mode and drag the Xcode 8 App. That simple.
